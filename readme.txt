06_read_write_with_condition - p1 writes user inputted string to shm and process 2 reads from shm with a condition to synchronize.
07_06_write_read_using_2_semaphores_works - p1 writes user inputted string to shm and process 2 reads from shm where two semaphore were used for better synchronization.
08a_08_filedata_shm_sem_working - p1 reads line by line from file and writes to shm and p2 reads from shm.
13_11_circular_buffer_with_two_shm_working - implementation of circular buffer where p1 writes inputted string to buffer and p2 reads from it.
13a_13_circular_buffer_with_two_shm_input_for_binary_file_working - implementation of circular buffer where p1 reads from binary file and writes to buffer and p2 reads from it.
